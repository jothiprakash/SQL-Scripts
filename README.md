# SQL-Scripts
Oracle SQL and PL/SQL scripts. Useful when preparing for interviews.

# Description:
Even if there are NoSQL databases to make the unstructured data rich, Structured data will always remain in the SQL databases only. Financial transactions and much more complicated datas are only stored in RDBMS systems because of their ACID compliance.

In this repository I will be publishing the SQL scripts I used when cracking the interviews. And further I will be working and updating this repository for the next 30 days(till April 30th).

**Don't worry about the data generation part. It is included too.**

## Use SQL-Developer IDE from Oracle for productivity and code management.
